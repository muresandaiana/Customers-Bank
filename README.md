#### This is a model with 2 hidden layers which can predict, based on a set of given information about a customer, if that customer will leave the bank or will stay. Informations about the customers are : customerId, surname, creditscore, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, numOfProducts, hasCrCard, isActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, exited. The model was created using Tensorflow library the Sequential class. Other informations are in the comments inside the code.

#### Tools needed : 
   -python 3.8
   -numpy 1.1.5(>=)
   -pandas 1.2.3(>=)
   -scikit-learn 0.24.1(>=)
   -tensorflow 2.4.1(>=)
#### Model was trained and testeed on MacBook Pro with CPU 2,7 GHz Dual Core Intel Core i5; Memory 8GB
